    <h1>Suggested Reading</h1>
    <p>
        I don't have nearly as much time to read books as I'd like nowadays, but I do have a few that I seem to keep coming back to.
    </p> 
    <p>
        In the future, if I read something really good, or if I find myself rereading something, again, I'll add it to this list, in hopes that some readers can discover something new and neat.

        <p>
            I have not actually read this book yet, but it comes highly recommended.
            <br /><br />
            I plan to work through it, creating another top-level page on this site for notes that I take, hopefully refreshing all the stuff I learned in university all those years ago.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-1-11-Practices/dp/0692915729/">Two Scoops of Django 1.11: Best Practices for the Django Web Framework</a>
        <p>
            Granted this is for Django 1.11, and we're currently on 2.1.5 at the time of writing, but it is a fantastic, humerous dive into learning all about Django.
            <br /><br />
            If you are going to be using the framework, I would highly recommend it.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155">Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture</a>
        <p>
            Masters of Doom is the true story of the two Johns - John Carmak and John Romero, and id Software, the revolutionary company they created.
            <br /><br />
            The book is a rollercoaster of excitement, and very inspiring for a dev who wants to be on the cutting edge of technology, pushing the understanding of what a computer can do.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985/dp/1468093657/">The Making of Prince of Persia: Journals 1985 - 1993</a>
        <p>
            This is a fascinating read, due largely to the fact that these are Jordan's actual journals, kept while he wrote Prince of Persia. A very unique look into what it took to make amazing games way back in the day.

        <p>
            The biography of Steve Wozniak, absolutely packed full of energy and fun, just like the man himself.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dice-Men-Dungeons-Dragons-People/dp/145164051X/">Of Dice and Men: The Story of Dungeons & Dragons and The People Who Play It</a>
        <p>
            It's been a while since I've read through Of Dice and Men, but it's a great read.  D&D is a game that has fundamentally changed the world, so learning about its roots with Gary Gygax and Gen Con is quite enjoyable.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-War-Artifacts-Cycle-ebook/dp/B07C91KLV8/">The Brothers' War</a>
        <p>
            Set in the Magic: The Gathering multiverse, a tale about two brothers, Urza and Mishra, whose feud erases entire planes of existence. 
            <br /><br />
            I joke with my brother that it's a great cautionary tale..

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595/">Neuromancer</a>
        <p>
            One of the first pieces of cyberpunk fiction I read, the first book in a trilogy that includes Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive. It is simply outstanding, and has inspired tons of dystopian fiction that came after it.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Androids-Dream-Electric-Sheep-inspiration/dp/0345404475/">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>
        <p>
            The famous book that inspired Blade Runner. Dark and cyberpunk, it explores what it means to be human, in a world full of "living" androids.
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0553380958/">Snow Crash</a>
        <p>
            Another classic piece of cyberpunk work. If you like the genre, you'll love this, if you somehow haven't read it already.
