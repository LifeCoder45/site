    <h1>Elixir & Phoenix Development Resources</h1>
    <p>
        In mid-2019, I read a post on Hackernews about a language called Elixir, which I had heard of by name, but that was about it. After spending some time looking into it, doing some tutorials, I got really excited, and dove in.

        This page will serve as a collection of links, books, and courses that I have enjoyed in my learning.

            "Programming Elixir" is a really solid read, although I didn't get much more out of it than I did by working through the official Elixir docs, as they're fantastic. I'm still glad to have it on the bookshelf.

            "Programming Phoenix" was fantastic, and still the best resource I've used to learn Phoenix-specific things. Working through a chat app with Presence and Channels was awesome.

            The official Elixir docs, they are extremely well done. Some of the denser topics like OTP are better suited for books / courses, but for the language itself, this is your best bet.

            The official Phoenix docs. They are pretty solid, but don't come close to depth and bredth of what Django's documentation offers.

            This post really opened my eyes as to who was actually using Elixir. Hearing about Pinterest, Discord and Pepsi really added some legitimacy early on when I was investigating the language.

            "Elixir and OTP" by The Pragmatic Studio. I'm currently (May 2020) in the middle of this course, and it is fantastic. The notes between videos are a brilliant idea.
